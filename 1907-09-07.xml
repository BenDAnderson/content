                    <head>Allenburys' DIET</head>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is a complete milk and farinaceous Food, easy of
                        assimilation, most agreeable to take, simply and quickly made. It is
                        recommended in place of ordinary milk foods, gruel, etc., and whilst
                        acceptable to all as a light nourishment, it is particularly helpful to
                        Dyspeptics, Invalids and the Aged. In the sick-room it will be found
                        invaluable and it is easily and quickly made, the addition of boiling water
                        only being necessary. </p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" DIET is readily digested by tose who are unable to take
                        cow's milk and is particularly serviceable in convalescence. When taken as a
                        light supper diet it will be found to promote tranquil and refreshing sleep.
                        Although this DIET is a good for ADULTS and is entirely distinct fom the
                        "Allenburys" Foods for Infants, yet it is also of great value as a
                        restorative food for young children, especially during convalescence. </p>

                    <head>DISCONTENT IN GERMANY.
                    </head>
                    <p>“The author, Herr Nissen-Meyer,
                        tired lieutenant-colonel of the German Army," says the New York "Nation," who for three commanded a detachment detailed for duty in China. Having returned from this foreign service, he has written a pessi nistin, although not wholly unpatriotic, eri- ticism his rative country and its people. He sees signs of deterioration in society, in the army, and the body politic. But he observes: Only whoever knows his faults can correct them. Two things, however, have impressed him favourably: one is the order which prevails in public life, and the other, the military way in which officials of all kinds impart information. Often politeness is wanting, but this is a matter of minor importance
                        "He laments chiefly the number of rest
                        and discontented persons who he has met in all stations of life, but particularly among the working people. The Germans are neat, class, and thrifty, but the party of the Extreme Left, the Social Democrats, is larger than in any other country in the world, being five times as great ad in England and nearly twice as great France
                        "Col. Nissen Meyer does not attribute this discontent to economic conditions. In Germany he finds a strong and bitter feeling of clas against clase-jealousy which takes
                        the trouble to conceal. Even the well to do are dissatisfied, and a large number of them have cast their lot with the Social Demo erney. How many are there asks the authors, who think a
                        do, bat
                        willing to express their opinions openly! Many things prove that the number of malcontents is by no means insignificant," For the depression of feeling is manifested not only in the demeanour and conversation of the people, but in the sinister tone of the press The condition will probably become worse as time goes on, and Col. Nissen Meyer fears that in contemporary Germany there are elements resembling those which wrought the disintegration of the old regime in Prussia The cases of the evils which he has served he finds partly in the character of the German people, and partly in the system under which they live. For one who boasts that his point of view in cosmopolitan and impartial, he here shows himself strangely got of the transplanted German the world over. For he toes the source of these defects to the mixture
                        f German with foreign blood, and to the contact of Germans with alien races. This conclusion has been reached apparently in order to justify the author's bitter dislike of the German colonial system. The colonies have been badly administered, and are hated at home; so that Germans prefer to put them selves under a foreign fag when they emigrate Yet the effects of foreign infoce spon Ger mans he declares to be bed; they become ostentations and are given to strong drink This is rather surprising information to Ame riosas Their observation is certainly different"

                        Our Suez correspondent reports, under the date of yesterday, that the homeward bound German steamer "Hagen," went ashore in the Suez Canal near station kilo 152, early that afternoon, and was blocking the traffic. She was, however, expected to be refloated at high tide the same evening.

                        The "Petit Journal'' gives an interesting account of the work of the Swiss seronaut Spelterini who, it will be remembered, gave interesting lectures at Cairo and Alexandria last season on his way and intrepid excursions, with most interesting photographs of Egypt taken by him from balloons. During his latest ascent, in which he traversed the Alps for the 50th time, he took some cinemetrograph views of the passing panorama. These have been shown in the usual way and are pronounced to be the most striking that have yet been exhibited. Except for a slight deviation from a rigid position occasioned by the baloon's movement, one has positively the effect of travelling over the landscape. The views were taken from an altitude of four kilometres and are the first attempted in the service of the cinematograph.

                        his fiancée, occurred in the Rae Averoff, and became serious that revolvers
                        were drawn and had it not been for the speedy and effective intervention of
                        the police we would probably have had to report a case of murder. We have
                        frequently had occasion to criticize "nos bons chaouicher" and are the
                        couple to bear testimony to the promptness with which they acted in this
                        instance. A Preich complex recently came from Marseilles together and an
                        engagement ensued, but the lady evidently grew tired of her lover and turned
                        her attention to an Italian. The jealousy of the rejected lover soon reached
                        the pitch of vengeance and when he approached the couple in Rue Averoff
                        yesterday evening murder was written in his eyes. The quarrel was at first
                        confined to words and the quondam lover tried to per nade the woman to
                        return to him, first by entreaty and then by threats. The Italian took up
                        the quarrel and, seized with anger, the Frenchman drew his revolver, but was
                        prevented from shooting by the policeman, who conducted all concerned to the
                        caracol, from where the Consuls of the parties were requested to enquire

                        The Sirdar has for a number of years taken his summer holiday at Dunbar, a quiet little golfing town on the east coast of Scotland. Sir Reginald has been in the habit of renting a mansion called Stafford House which overlooks the Dunbar Harbour. It is now his in- tention to build a residence of his own and for this purpose he has selected an eminence known as Knock-In-Hair. This hill stands about half a mile distant from Dunbar and commands an immense view of the Firth of Forth, the German Ocean and the Counties of Fife, Berwick and Haddington. The house when completed should be a commanding object in the district. The spot is a historical one. It was a signal station at the time of Napoleon's threatened invasion, and was also at one time said to have served the purposes of a windmill. The tower derived its name from the strange circumstances that women used to congregate around it, when watch-fires were kindled within its dome, and as they witnessed the wreck of fishing boats contain- ing their breadwinners they dashed their heads against its walls

                        The Harem of the Ghezireh Palace is being demolished with a view to the construction of the new road which will lead from Ghezireh to the proposed new bridge across the river.
                        The works in question point to an improvement in property values on the Island of Ghezireh and there is every reason to hope that the news we announce will give a fillip to the present stagnancy in town and suburban plot. It is worthy of note that the Anglo-Belgian Company have made rapid strides in the completion of their building at Ghezireh, designed for residential flats and, although the work can hardly be completed before the early months of next year, yet the Company have already made contracts with Government officials and private parties for the flats available It is noticeable that the Anglo-Belgian Company are the first to build on the Ghezireh Estate and it is to be hoped that their enterprise will be rewarded by the success it merits.

                        M. le président déclare que l'assemblée est valablement constituée puisque 48,010 actions sont présentes ou représentées.
                        Une discussion s'engage aussitôt au sujet de ce qui s'est passé entre MM. Jacques et Albert Arditi et le Conseil d'administration. Finalement Me Devonshire intervient et fait observer que toutes ces discussions sont superflues et qu'il est inutile de s'y attarder; il s'agit de savoir aujourd'hui si, oui ou non, Société doit être mise en liquidation. Le président prévient l'Assemblée de gravité de la situation
                        En tenant une autre assemblée à huitaine, on courrait le risque de se trouver en présence d'une demande en faillite de la part d'un créancier quelconque; il décline de ce chef toute responsabilité
                        Au cas où l'assemblée voudrait se réunir à nouveau, il la prie de le faire sous son entière responsabilité

                        Le bilan, arrêté à la date du 6 août et qui a été communiqué à l'assemblée, fait ressortir un solde en caisse de LE 184 et 599 mill. la valeur des terrains appartenant à la Société est représentée par 4,893 LE, le compte des débiteurs divers de la Société par LE 211.092, la valeur des titres en portefeuille aux cours du 6 août par LE 20,254, celle de l'agencement par LE 1.115 et enfin les pertes se soldent par LE 42,580 et 489 mill

                        A fire broke out yesterday morning at the Marina, at five minutes to ten, the scene of which was a private house belonging to native. On the arrival of the brigade within four minutes of the call, the men found the wife of the owner lying in the gutter, she having in a state of uncontrollable panic, thrown herself from the roof. The woman was in a dying condition and was taken charge of by the police for transfer to hospital. The police had considerable difficulty in holding back the surging mob, which swelled in proportions as every moment passed, and threaten- ed to greatly handicap the firemen in their work of fighting the flames, but the police did their work splendidly and put forward every effort to assist Superintendent Waller and his gallant band of fire-fighters.
                        The brigade found on their arrival that the fire had assumed such serious proportions, owing to the flames having been greatly aided by the fresh breeze which was prevailing and apparently by the dryness of the lath and plaster of which the building was chiefly composed, that two steamers were summoned from other stations to assist the plant taken from Menshieh. Difficulty faced the fire-brigade in another direction, the nearest hydrant being about 2,000 feet from the scene of the conflagration. The Alexandria Fire Brigade, however, is accustomed to overcoming such difficulties with a smartness which has characterised it now for many years, and they got to work in an incredibly short space of time. After the brigade had been playing on the fire for about a quarter of an hour, one of the firemen who was working inside the burning building dis- covered the body of an infant lying on the floor of one of the rooms. The poor mite had been badly burnt and presented a ghastly sight; it was beyond help, and the fireman, whose duty forbids him to be troubled by the thought of a helpless babe left to the mercy of the devouring flames by a panic-stricken mother, snatched it up in his arms and handed it over to those in charge.
                        Two of the rooms were totally destroyed, the fire penetrating from one storey to the other. Another room was badly damaged, and the passage of the floor in which the fire originated was also destroyed, but the scientific manner in which the fire was fought kept the flames from spreading to other rooms opening upon it. The damages have not yet been estimated.                    </p>

                        A fire broke out soon after nine o'clock on Thursday night in the Gamaliel District, Khan Khalil, Cairo. Fortunately the alarm was promptly given and as the ordinarily congested traffic in the Mousky was suspended the brigade lost very little time in getting to the scene of the conflagration.
                        On the arrival of the firemen on the spot the paper store, where the fire originated, was well alight. The efforts of the brigade were directed to the limiting of the fire. Their efforts were attended with every success and the spread of the fire was efficiently checked and the area restricted, as well as a large quantity of the shop salvaged. The damage is estimated at £300 uninsured. The cause of the outbreak is unknown.

                        A German semi-official journalistic organ admits that Germany cannot oppose the pacification of Morocco by France if disorders in the Barbary States continue. The newspaper at the same time regrets that events are successively occurring in Morocco to afford France excuses for step after step of encroach- ment.
                        Under the terms of the Algeciras convention France and Spain are named as the executive committee of the Powers to preserve the status quo in Morocco. In consequence Germany is stopped by her own signature from objecting to French and Spanish interposition at a time when lives of Europeans have been taken in a Moorish city and when a holy war against Christians is being preached throughout the sultanate.
                        Nor can Germany at this time well oppose herself to the will of Europe and the obvious destiny of the whole Mediterranean coast of Africa. That coast separated from Europe by a ses which bears ships in multitude, is parted from the rest of Africa by the waste of the Sahars. In other words, Egypt and the Barbary States are related to Europe and not to Africa. They were as truly in the pale of the ancient Mediterranean civilization as were Italy and Hellas. Their historical separation from Europe in the middle age was accomplished by an Asistie, not by an African influence-the invasion from Arabia
                        England shrank at first from her task in Egypt, just as Prance has been hindered from finally putting her hand to the plough in Morocco But Egypt by the force of events is as finally British as is India, just as to tomorrow, the better portion of Morocco is likely to become finally French.
                        England is in Egypt to-day and may be in Syria tomorrow. France is in Algiers and Tunis, and will be in Morocco. Tripoli is fated to become Italian. Thus will the fertile southern shores of the Mediterranean, that once knew Greek Alexandria, Semitic Carthage, and and Roman Utios, be again wholly restored to civilization and commerce.

                        Yet another report is at hand of the collapse of a house, to which a human being has fallen a victim. Shortly before noon on Thursday a loud crash aroused those in the neighbourhood of Sharia Nil, Karmous, and rushing from their houses the people saw a huge cloud of dust. On reaching the scene, the debris of a fallen house met the eye, and the fire-brigade was immediately called to the rescue of those lying buried beneath the ruins. On their arrival they discovered that two men, a woman, and a child had been buried, and setting to work they quickly recovered the child, while the others were all rescued within an hour, the last to be extricated being the woman. The two men had escaped with slight injuries, only having been held down by the weight of the material, but both woman and child were suffering badly from shock and severe contusions. The latter two were conveyed to hospital, where the child has since died. The woman is progressing favourably.

                        TO THE EDITOR OF THE "BOTPTIAN GAZETTE Sir-To your many readers an interesting item in yesterday's issue is that re Haji A. Browne, whom you remark was "an Irishman and the only Englishman who ever saw" etc.
                        Ya salaam ya sidi! How can an Irishman. be an Englishman ↑ He is too often referred to as the latter by English papers when he, the Irishman, proves himself an interesting and worthy character. On the contrary an Irish- man is never an Englishman when he raises a dust and kicks the stars out of the heavens! All English papers have of late carefully Avoided referring to "loyal Belfast" as even British (Tho' it is not). That city of diversions and bloody ructions is pro. tem most severely Irish as it should be.
                        John Bull should know an Irishman is always an Irishman, whether wrong or right and should be so alluded to, and would prefer being termed a South Sea Islander rather than a mere Englishman, because the former would be noticed as a possible error and the latter too often adds stolen glory to already famous John Bull while deducting it from the ever woeful descendants of the gallant warrior Red Branch Knights of Erin.
                        It's a distinctly unpardonable error to call an Irishman an Englishman; it's the reverse of compliment. The most ignorant Patrick Murphy is proud of his ancient country, race, language, peculiar features (if he has any 1) larger head, harder cranium, inherited ideas, mentality and literature, and never, no never forgets,
                        "That Ireland was Ireland"
                        When England was pup"
                        Which is literally true except the "pup" which happens to be a Celtic poetic allusion to England's comparative juvenility.
                        It was the old fashioned square-headed Englishmen who best understood the Celts and in justice invented "Great Britain and Ireland," this wee word "AND" should ever be in large capitals for the benefit of modern Englishmen, as Irishmen, historically and every- way, are not even Britishers
                        The true Scot, tho' of pure Irish descent has fairer treatment, he is seldom called English and often gets this full benefit of his birth- place which he acknowledges with a Caledonian grant and does not dislike. He won't say he likes it, as he is cautious, which is extraordinary since his Celtic forefathers and present cousins are famed for reckless indiscretion.
                        Anyway, Mr. Editor, please do give Irishmen, loyal and disloyal, the full benefit of their ancestry and they will always feel grateful.

                    GOLD IN MADAGASCAR
                    STARTLING NEW DISCOVERIES
                </head>
                    <p>
                        The following letter, addressed to the Editor of "The African World," from Tamatave, under date July 25, will be read with great interest by many of our readers:
                        Dear Sir,-The following are the exact facts concerning the new and startling discoveries o gold in this island, which have of late created so much excitement here.
                        Some time ago a prospector named Mortgage pegged out certain claims in a district north of Diego Suares, known as Adawa Rivere, a tract of land facing the island of Nossi-Be, about three days' march (by carriers) from the town and harbour of Diego Suarez
                        In order to pursue his work he borrowed money from a French merchant of Diego Suares, named Grignon. With his help he managed to engage 200 native "boys," and established his headquarters in Anta Rata, in the middle of his claims. The "boys' ' went out every day round the mountains, and every week they came to him with the result of their pannings. These were always in insignificant quantities, and indicated that the prospecting was doing very little good. Lately the results were a little better, the "boys" bringing many grammes of gold, most of it mixed with quartz dust
                        Mortgage noticed that one of the "boys' invariably had more gold than the others, and it was detrimental to follow him. He disguised himself as a carrier and did so.
                        After a long trip Mortgage joined the boy at nearly the top of a hill a few kilometres in length-and you may judge his surprise at finding that nearly all the mountain and the full perimetre formed a splendid goldfield!
                        He at once pegged twenty claims, and went back to fetch his friend Grignon. Together they fenced all the ground as much as possible, and started at once putting all the boys to work
                        The first week they crushed in a primitive style, and the result (after panning the dust nearly without water) was :-
                        1. Eight days: R. 12 kilos.
                        2. Eight days: R. 79.500 grammes. 3. Eight days: R. 55.
                        Total: 146 500 kilos of gold for less than a month's work-making in value (at 3,000 francs per kilo approximately) the amount of nearly 450,000 francs
                        Being satisfied with this splendid result, they stopped the exploitation, set the necessary watch, and left trustworthy people in their place.
                        They then returned to Diego Suares and deposited the gold at the Comptoir National d'escompte de Paris.
                        The are now waiting to get out engineers and machinery for more effective crushing from Prance
                        The Government Service of Mines have controlled the gold and published a report certifying that all details and the amounts of gold stated to have been recovered are
                        correct
                        The discoveries that made may entirely change the future of the island of Mada gor
                        I am told that the number of claims already pegged is twenty, and that the quartz is everywhere the same as an extraordinarily rich sample which I have been shown. Further developments are anxiously w ed-Yours faithfully. EDGAR ROGER

                        At the exhibition of Prehistoric Anthropology recently held at Strasbourg much interest was aroused by the mummy of a Greek- physician of the Roman Imperial period discovered at Akhmin in Upper Egypt, and now belonging to the collection of Dr. Forrer, the Swiss paleontologist and antiquary. The mummy, which is in perfect preservation, was that of a certain Paulos, surnamed Iatron, "the healer." The mummy had not the familiar shape of such relics, but was merely a long parallelogram; it was wrapped round in a toga clavate of fine linen, adorned with bands and circular patches of purple. The chin was bearded and around the neck was a wreath of Bowers, and a ribbon of honour was wound about the feet.

                        Classic geographers and the doyen of writers upon natural history, Pliny the Elder, all re- lated stories of certain wild tribes inhabiting the torrid wadys and plate and between the Nile and the Red Sea, whom they termed Agriophages or eaters of ferocious animals They are spoken of in the Periplus or descriptive chart, of the Red Sea, whose authorship is generally attributed to Arrian; also by the geographer Solinus, and, as stated, by Pliny.

                        There is now a latin inscription in the Museum at Alexandria which confirms the statements of the classics. It records an expedition in the time of the Emperor Hadrian undertaken against these Agriophages. The commander of the Roman forces was named Sulpicius Serenes, and his exploits were a inscribed in duplicate in Latin and in Greek.

                        In his address to the British Association at Leicester Mr. D.G. Hogarth M.A. referring to "Religious Survivals spoke of Mahomet of having, subsequent to the lessons of his exile at Medina, learnt, that the Semitic people could not be weaned to a perfectly spi- ritual system, and so came to terms with the primeval worship of the Arabian goddess at Meccs, but displaced her personality by retaining many expressions of her popular cult. However this may be, and to whatever deity Mr. Horgath was referring, the prophet did not mince matters as to some feminine members of the pantheon.
                        It is known that previous to his ers and to the writing of the Koran, the religion of the Arabs around Meces and Medina, and indeed wherever they roamed, was polytheistic and that they worshipped numerous deities of both sexes. In promulgating his monotheistic reli- gion the prophet necessarily denounced all other gods than Allah, and being anti-femin istje in his theology, though scarcely so in his domestic relations, Mahomet especially warns his followers gsinato female deities Among three anathematised in chapter 58 of the Korsa are three known as Art, Manat APO, and Manát of these Allat pagan pantheon was the feminine

A Yemenite, or Himyaritie monumental text recently acquired by the Louvre however clearly mentions Al'Os The inscription dates from about AD-350 Its contents describe the consecration of a memorial to the goddess Our by her devo- tees, the dedicator of the monument and his daughter.
                        These Ouzza worshippers were therefore two persons who adored one of these early Arabian goddesses of whom Mahomet mid They are nothing more than names given by yourselves" "you and your ancestors, without Allah ever having bestowed on them" title of power"
